# typing-test

This is a cool Typing test application to measure your typing speed > just go to the "Take a Test" page and test your typing to see what is your score!

It was the first App that I write using Expressjs (backend) Angularjs(frontend), I could make it even better from structure :) 

To run it locally :

>npm install

then

>bower install

then 

browse to the service folder (to run the API)
>node server.js

browse to the main folder (to run the UI)
>gulp   

I need to update some structure like adding models, services , when I have time!
